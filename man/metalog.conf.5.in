.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
[default values] will be used if you do not redefine them in a section.
You can choose <section title> as you wish. It doesn't mean anything, just
allow you to keep an easy to read config file.

Values names can be one of the following:
.TP
\fBmaxsize\fR = \fI<number (bytes)>\fR
Once a logfile has exceeded the value defined (in bytes), it will be rotated.
If \fBmaxfile\fR is equal to zero, it disables log rotation.
Defining a default value is a good idea.
.TP
\fBmaxtime\fR = \fI<number (seconds)>\fR
Once a logfile is older than the value defined (in seconds), it will be rotated.
Defining a default value is a good idea.

NB: A logfile is rotated when either \fBmaxsize\fR or \fBmaxtime\fR limit is
reached. If either one or both is equal 0, then log rotation is disabled.
.TP
\fBmaxfiles\fR = \fI<number>\fR
This value indicates the maximum number of rotated files kept.
So you'll have x rotated files (log-date-string filename type), plus the file
named "current".
.TP
\fBfacility\fR = \fI"<facility>"\fR
Only records a message if the application that issued it uses syslog facility
<facility>. Facility names are : "auth", "authpriv", "cron", "daemon", "ftp",
"kern", "lpr", "mail", "news", "security", "syslog", "user", "uucp", "local0",
"local1" ... "local7". All kernel messages are logged with facility "kern".
A section can have several "facility = ..." lines to match more than one
facility. If <facility> is "*", it'll match all the facilities.
.TP
\fBremote_host\fR = \fI"<IP address or domain name>"\fR
Log entries are sent to the remote log server defined by this IP address or
domain name. Only one remote log server can be defined. This can only be defined
in the default values section. All log messages are sent there, limitations via
"ratelimit", "ratelimit_burst" or "showrepeats" are ignored for log message sent
to the remote log server. In case a domain or host name is configured, the
necessary DNS request will be repeated after every failed attempt or after
120 seconds when the name has been successfully resolved.
.TP
\fBremote_port\fR = \fI"<value>"\fR
The UDP port of the remote log server. Default is "514". This can only be
defined in the default values section.
.TP
\fBremote_log\fR = \fI"<number>"\fR
Default is \fI0\fR. Log messages are sent to the remote log server when set
to \fI1\fR. Can be defined for default values or in sections.
.TP
\fBbreak\fR = \fI<number>\fR
Default is \fI0\fR.
If set to \fI1\fR and a section is matched, perform action, but don't consider
any more possible section matches below this one in the config file.
This is useful for creating a config where specific types of log messages are
matched and dispatched, while a "catch-all" section at the bottom of the config
file handles the default case.

Using \fI0\fR would cause messages to be potentially handled by multiple
sections, causing message duplication, while using \fI1\fR on the sections above
a final "catch-all" would avoid duplication.
.TP
\fBminimum\fR = \fI<level>\fR
Only record a message if its urgency is inferior or equal to \fI<level>\fR.
Level '0' is the most critical one, while level '7' is for debugging messages.
\fI5\fR will strip all non-important messages.
The default minimum level is \fI7\fR (i.e. keep all messages).
.TP
\fBmaximum\fR = \fI<level>\fR
Don't log if the message level exceeds that value.
By default, \fBmaximum\fR is the largest possible level.
.TP
\fBlogdir\fR = \fI"/dir/where/logs/will/be/written/"\fR
Files will be written under the specified directory. The special value \fI"NONE"\fR will
skip the log message.
.TP
\fBperms\fR = \fI<mode>\fR
Permissions for the log directory. Defaults to \fI0700\fR
.TP
\fBprogram\fR = \fI"name"\fR
Can be used to do filtering instead of \fBfacility\fR.
Remember to use the executable name.
.TP
\fBregex\fR = \fI"perl compatible regular expression"\fR
Can be used when you only want to log messages that match the \fIpattern\fR
(like "invalid", "fail", etc...) to send them to a single directory.

Multiple \fBregex\fR may be defined in a single section, only one must match.
.TP
\fBneg_regex\fR = \fI"perl compatible regular expression"\fR
Can be used when you only want to log messages that do not match the \fIpattern\fR.

A \fBneg_regex\fR match will override any \fBregex\fR matches and not log the
message.

When one or more \fBregex\fR are provided, at least one of them must match to
log the message. The lack of any \fBregex\fR will result in message being
logged when no \fBneg_regex\fR match.

Multiple \fBneg_regex\fR may be defined in a section, only one must match.
.TP
\fBpostrotate_cmd\fR = \fI"/path/to/a/program"\fR
Run specified program after a log file has been rotated.

The program is passed the date, the program name ("metalog"), and the new logfile name.
.TP
\fBprogram_regex\fR = \fI"perl compatible regular expression"\fR
Similar to \fBprogram\fR, this is a regex that matches the program name to send
all messages from related programs to the same log file.

Multiple \fBprogram_regex\fR may be defined in a section, only one must match.
.TP
\fBprogram_neg_regex\fR = \fI"perl compatible regular expression"\fR
The inverse of \fBprogram_regex\fR to filter out logs from programs that match.

A \fBprogram_neg_regex\fR match will override any \fBprogram_regex\fR matches
and not log the message.

When one or more \fBprogram_regex\fR are provided, at least one of them must
match to log the message. The lack of any \fBprogram_regex\fR will result in
message being logged when no \fBprogram_neg_regex\fR match.

Multiple \fBprogram_neg_regex\fR may be defined in a section, only one must match.
.TP
\fBshowrepeats\fR = \fI<number>\fR
Set to \fI0\fR to filter out repeat log messages.
.TP
\fBcommand\fR = \fI"/path/to/program/to/execute"\fR
Run the specified program as soon as something is logged in a given section.

The program is passed the date, the matching program name, and the log message.
.TP
\fBstamp_fmt\fR = \fI"%b %e %T"\fR
Format of the human readable timestamp prepended to all log messages.
The format string supports all conversion specifications from strftime plus %[nnn]N for nanoseconds
(default: nine numbers long, can be shortened with nnn < 9).
The format string with %[nnn]N replaced is then passed to the
.BR strftime (3)
function.
An empty string is used to disable timestamps (for cases where the log messages
already include its own).
.TP
\fBflush\fR = \fI<number>\fR
If set to \fI0\fR, matching log messages will always be buffered.
If set to \fI1\fR, they will always be written to the file system immediately.

Both settings override the global default given through
command line parameters (\fB\-a\fR/\fB\-s\fR) or signals.
.TP
\fBratelimit\fR = \fI"5/m"\fR
Limits the rate of logged messages to the specified number of messages per unit
of time.
Valid units of time are \fIs\fRecond, \fIm\fRinute, \fIh\fRour and \fId\fRay,
each identified by its first letter.
Fractional values are allowed such as \fI"0.5/m"\fR to make human parsing easier.

A limit of \fI0\fR (the default) may be used to disable any rate limit handling.
In this case, the unit of time may be omitted.
.TP
\fBratelimit_burst\fR = \fI<number>\fR
Up to this number of lines will be printed at the beginning of a burst of message,
if the rate of messages has been well below the limit before.
The specified message rate will not be exceeded.
The default value of 1 disables special treatment for bursts.
Values less than 1 are invalid and will be rejected.
