    Mathias Kretschmer bug fix for kernel logging integrated.
    Added TODO file in tree for those who want to help :)
    Config file was updated.
    Log rotation can now be disabled with maxsize or maxtime = 0.

    -> Now log some metalog internal stuff instead of dumping it to stderr     
    -> Better rotation (e.g. always rotate at 0:00 if doing daily rotation)    

* Version 0.7 :
    Autoconf/automake scripts were modernized.
    Portability improvements : import fakesnprintf/mysnprintf and
Pure-FTPd and OpenBSD's getopt_long() from Pure Load Balancer.
    Fixes to the setproctitle() emulation on Linux.
    New command-line argument : --pidfile=... (pid_file global)
    New command-line argument : --async. Switch to the synchronous mode by
default.
    New command-line argument : --configfile=... (config_file global).
    Introduce the DuplicateTracker structure into Output, used in
writeLogLine().
    New configuration file keyword : "maximum". Just works like "minimum".
    Re-implement neg_regex, program_regex and program_neg_regex. Instead of
storing vanilla regexes, a RegexWithSign structure was introduced, to add
whether we are successful when the regex matches (.sign = REGEX_SIGN_POSITIVE)
or when it doesn't match (.sign = REGEX_SIGN_NEGATIVE) .
    Revamped the spec file.
    --with-sysconfdir is now honoured, but defaults to /etc.
